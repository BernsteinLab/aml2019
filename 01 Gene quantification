# Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38) using STAR version 2.5.2b and default parameters. Alignments were guided by using RefSeq gene annotations. Transcripts were quantified using the “--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM” option. This resulted in two alignment files, one in which reads were aligned to the genome, and one which contained pseudo-alignments to the transcriptome.
# The transcriptome alignments were used to quantify gene expression. For every read all the unique gene names of the transcripts the read aligned to were recorded. Some reads aligned to multiple genes, which often reflected a primary gene and one or more pseudo-, antisense-, or readthrough-genes. We checked if any of the gene names was contained in all the other gene names, with a “-” before or after (antisense- and readthrough-genes), or followed by “P” and a digit (pseudo-genes). If this was the case, we only kept the primary gene. Reads that still mapped to multiple genes were filtered. In a second step, all reads that mapped to the same gene and had an identical UMI sequence were collapsed. This yielded a digital expression matrix consisting of UMI counts for each cell and gene.
# For all downstream analysis we required cells to have at least 1,000 UMIs (gene counts, indicative of the number of captured transcripts) mapping to at least 500 unique genes. We additionally excluded cells for which more than 20% of the gene counts reflected either mitochondrial genes or ribosomal RNAs, as these likely reflected poor quality cells. Resulting digital expression matrices for each sample were deposited in GEO. For downstream analyses, we normalized gene counts to a total of 10,000 for each cell.
